C++ program: Send over the state s.
    in nn-input.txt
Use the neural network to predict the value Q(s, a) for all actions a.
    Done by predict-RL-model
Python script: come up with an action A and send it. Usually the a that leads to the maximum Q(s, a) but sometimes random.
    Done by predict-RL-model. Put in output.txt.
C++ program: apply A and come up with a reward r. Send r back.
    Done after 1 second. r appended to output.txt.
    The new state s' is also sent over in nn-input.txt.
Python script: Compare r + gamma*max(Q(s', a')) to Q(s, a) and adjust model.
    Done by predict-RL-model again.

Later, copy neural network theta to theta'?
